What are my stream priorities and projects in 2022?

## Priorities

- Open source software contributions
  - Low level Haskell: speeds up code execution for the entire community
  - Cryptography: intrinsically _mathy_, potentially engaging conceptually
  - Unison: _something goes here_

## Projects

- Zero to Haskell Language Server
- [SnailScheme](https://github.com/chiroptical/snailscheme): A scheme implementation for teaching interpreters in Haskell
- [Cataract](https://github.com/chiroptical/cataract): An HTTP driven Twitch overlay
- Low level Haskell projects which may need help,
  - https://github.com/haskell-text/diablo
  - https://github.com/kozross/diablerie
- Haskell crytography working group may need help,
  - https://github.com/haskell-cryptography

## Project Ideas

- A Lua backend for Purescript (e.g. write you vim config in Purescript)
- A CSV exploration and parsing tool using higher kinded data
  - Idea: start with a dirty CSV and instantiate a `Row (Either ParseErrors) a` and work towards `Row Identity a` filling in `ParseErrors`
  - [barbies](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/barbies) might be useful here?
  - [opaleye](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye) does something like this
